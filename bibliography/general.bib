	abstract = {This book is organized into 11 chapters.
Chapter 1 deals with general terminology used in power quality, reliability, and the ITI (CBEMA) curve.
Chapter 2 discusses SVCs used in main transmission systems, as well as those used to correct unbalances due to traction loads. 
Chapter 3 deals with the control of the SVCs both for main transmission systems and those used to compensate unsymmetric traction single-phase loads.
Chapter 4 considers harmonics and their sources.
Chapter 5 describes the utility harmonic regulations and standards. 
Chapter 6 focuses on the undesirable effects of harmonics and mitigation techniques. 
Chapter 7 presents the computation tools that are available for the design and analysis of SVCs and harmonic filters. 
Chapter 8 is devoted to the different aspects of monitoring power quality. 
Chapter 9 presents the constructional details of HV reactors and the considerations involved in the choice of their location at the end of EHV lines, tertiary windings of transformers, etc. 
Chapter 10 describes the use of shunt capacitors for reactive compensation and power factor correction. 
Chapter 11 presents fast Fourier transforms (FFT).},

	title = {Power {Factor} {Correction} and {Harmonics}},
	abstract = {Two parts.  First part explains what power factor is, how harmonics impact on power factor, and how to correct power factor. Second part explains what harmonics are, what causes them (switch mode power supplies, adjustable speed drives, DC drives, and electronic ballasts); impacts of harmonics (not much on heating, most impact on data processing/communications equipment), and how to deal with them (filtering).},

	abstract = {Presents examples of using "Porto-Sag" to assess the impact of voltage sags on equipment.  Voltage sags are "the most important pq variation affecting sensitive equipment".  Voltage sags are defined in terms of magnitude (i.e. 50\% of nominal) and duration (i.e. 4 cycles). Results on various computers (Dell, HP netserver, Compaq) show actual values for voltage sags that induce equipment failure.  Also looked at PLCs, relays, adjustable speed drives.},

	url = {http://www.ee.co.za/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Vector%202013/no%20harmony.pdf},
	abstract = {Harmonic currents generated by non-linear electronic loads increase power system heat losses and power bills for end users. These harmonic-related losses reduce system efficiency, cause apparatus overheating, and increase power and air conditioning costs. As the number of harmonics-producing loads has increased over the years, it has become increasingly necessary to address their influence when making any additions or changes to an installation.  Harmonic currents can have a significant impact on electrical distribution systems and the facilities they feed. It is important to consider their impact when planning additions or changes to a system. In addition, identifying the size and location of non-linear loads should be an important part of any maintenance, troubleshooting and repair program.},
