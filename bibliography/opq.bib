	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7324875/},
	abstract = {The quality of the electrical supply has a direct impact on the correct function and operation of equipment connected to the public electricity supply network. There is an expectation that devices will operate as designed and that equipment lifetime should, statistically, be close to the designed value. The reliability of the network is generally assumed to be high enough so as to not cause unacceptable issues with regard to loss of production or loss of functionality. Quantifying the cost to the consumer when the supply power quality or reliability are not as expected is an important metric and can be used as business case to justify expenditure in order to improve the supply network. This paper explores the research associated with quantifying the cost of reliability and power quality. Several power quality disturbances are investigated and possible methods of quantifying both the effect and cost are presented. Due to the complex nature of equipment performance with regard to power quality, there is a need for extensive research in order to develop a generalised approach to lifetime and cost evaluation.},

	abstract = {Power Quality assessment is today one of the main ways to improve energy efficiency. International standards tend to restrict the way this assessment is done, by defining the measurements methods that should be adopted by an instrument. This work describes some of the constrictions and requirements assumed for the design of the high performance Power Quality data logger PQ1000, taking into account the international standards IEC 61000-4-30 Class A and the IEC 61000-4-15 published in August 2010. Trough it, the most important demands of the IEC 61000-4-30 class A instruments are exposed. Details of the hardware components are also shown, and the most important points of the signal processing path are explained. The performance in the RMS values determination is given, also the frequency response for harmonics measurement are shown, and a detailed analysis of fulfillment of the tests given in the IEC 61000-4-15 ed. 08-2010 are given in the final section. Before the publication of this ed.08-2010 the Cigre C4.1.01/CIRED 2 CC02/UIE WG2 - 2004 protocol was the reference document that in addition with the IEC standard was used for the evaluation of digital flicker meters. This protocol aim is to guarantee a higher degree of compatibility between instruments of different manufacturers and models. The tests here presented intend to submit the equipments to a more real situation, and try to show possible hardware or firmware defects. The results given by the PQ1000 widely surpasses the standards exigencies.},

	abstract = {This paper describes countrywide electrical power quality (PQ) assessments of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System through a genuine PQ database. The database stores the output of mobile PQ measurement systems which are established at 172 transformer substations of the transmission system. At 601 measurement points in these substations, which are potentially critical in terms of PQ, measurements are carried out by the mobile systems for a period of 1 week. PQ parameters defined in the IEC-61000- 4-30 standard in addition to power values are calculated from acquired raw data by the mobile-monitoring system and the resulting data are transferred to the PQ database. The database, based on a novel PQ data model, enables its users to take PQ snapshots of the transmission system countrywide and can be accessed through several interfaces including a visual query interface, a natural language interface, and a map interface. The overall PQ status of the measured points, representing the characteristics of the transmission system, is assessed through these interfaces and problematic points are determined while deriving important conclusions about the transmission system’s PQ behavior. Moreover, several novel PQ assessment methods are proposed and their applications on the PQ data are demonstrated especially through the map interface.},

	abstract = {A good power quality (PQ) is an important factor for the reliable operation of electrical loads. High penetration of nonlinear loads, such as compact fluorescent lamps, light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, switching mode power suppliers give rise to serious challenges in power quality for distribution systems. Harmonic distortion produced by nonlinear loads causes several problems, ranging from increased power losses in customer equipment, power transformers and power lines, shorter life of organic insulation to malfunction of electronic devices and telecommunication systems.  Last decade power quality issues have become serious concern for commercial and office customers. According to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimates, more than 70\% of all loads are nonlinear.  The IEEE and international standards [1, 2] set the limits for harmonic distortions. However they do not offer any strategy for the detection of distorting sources in the grid.  Information on the location of the distorted sources can be obtained by distributed measurement system abled to perform simultaneous measurements in different nodes of the considered grid.  This paper describes a distributed measurement system for power quality monitoring. The results of PQ measurements are reported.},

Power quality monitoring IED based on the design of IEC61850 standard for substation automation system can unify device external port, effectively solve interoperability problem of different devices, and greatly simplify the architecture design and communication network of large-scale power quality management system. This article develops a high-performance distributed power quality monitoring IED based on I EC6 1850 standard. The IED is composed by three cores high-performance PowerPC, D S P and FPGA. So it can realize high-speed acquisition, real-time processing and analysis of huge amounts of data. It supports both high-speed analog sampling and digital sampling that means the IED can receive IEC61850-9-2 packets through SV module. The SV and CPU modules exchange real-time data via high-speed LVDS bus on the backplane. The monitoring IED can be installed on any monitoring node as its distributed architecture design. Through MMS service the remote monitoring center collects power quality data of all monitoring nodes, according to the data analysis, completes the funtions of power quality disturbance identification, power quality disturbance source localization, power quality assessment, etc.},

This paper aims to present a system that was developed on the CompactRIO controller from National Instruments. As a programming tool, LabVIEW software was used to elaborate the platform in order to monitor and to detect disturbances that can occur in any power system.  Methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the Wavelet transform were used to monitor harmonics on the system and to detect short time voltage variations. When a short duration voltage fluctuation or an exceeding in the harmonic limits is noticed, the implemented system records the event time for further analysis. The platform also records all the signal in the time domain continuously without any blank window. The postprocessing is performed using the samples of the recorded signal. The analyzer can choose the amount of pre- and/or post event time, in 60 Hz cycles, to rebuild the event waveform. To validate the platform, it was subjected to tests such as the system voltage variation, momentary interruption, voltage sag and violations in harmonic distortion rates.},

	abstract = {Electric power as a commodity is very different from other products – it is generated far from the point of use, is fed to the grid together with the output of many other generators and arrives at the point of use via several transformers and many kilometers of overhead and possibly underground cabling. Quality check of power is very important. But it has constantly been polluted by both consumers (non-linear loads) and utility companies (due to increased use of semi conductor based power processors). Assuring the quality of delivered power to be good enough for the application at hand calls for measurement and study of power quality at the point of common coupling.

There are various categories of Power Quality issues. Issues related to voltage amplitude variations will include voltage sags/dips and voltage swells. Issue related to frequency is harmonics in the power system. Short term problems include transients and momentary interruptions. We have carried out a brief study of all these PQ issues, and problems caused by them.

Developments in the field of power electronics has brought tremendous power processing capability to engineers but it has also polluted the power system with harmonics. Then there are non linear loads that inject harmonics in the power system. Measurement and estimation of harmonics in power system has become one of the most important tasks in the hands of power system engineers for increasing reliability and quality of supplied power. For harmonic analysis FFT based schemes are unable to give enough information for PQ mitigation. So researchers have been attempting other methods to estimate harmonics in sampled voltage and current signals. Among these; least square estimation, for estimating amplitudes and particle swarm optimization with passive congregation, for estimating phase and frequency used together has most attractive features of compactness and fastness. We have developed a harmonic estimator based on LSE and PSOPC to estimate amplitude, phase and frequency of the sampled signal. We have used the estimator on real time data acquired using a digital storage oscilloscope in Electrical Machines Laboratory of Department of Electrical Engineering at NIT Rourkela. The results for estimating integral harmonics are attractive and encourage researchers to modify the estimator code to make it able to estimate inter-harmonics and sub-harmonics also.},

The cost of poor PQ is high and rising. The paper gives insights on global economical losses due to poor PQ. The business risk posed by PQ problems is a real one with even ‘low tech’ industries exposed to serious financial losses. The global economic meltdown is not the only factor that is pulling down the revenues of Asian countries. A study released said Indian industries lost more than \$ 9.6 billion in 2008-09 due to power outages. According to 2008 reports, poor power quality costs European business more than 150 billion dollars a year.

In this paper, a comprehensive survey on different power quality related problems as experienced by customers in different countries are highlighted. Summary of PQ costs are given. As the consequence of poor PQ might have large financial impacts on a country’s economy, more initiatives are expected from the concerned parties and regulating bodies to take corrective measures for maintaining better power quality from utility and at end users. Smart grid requires intelligent PQ monitoring to solve different PQ related problems. Authors proposed an intelligent power quality monitoring system that will help to detect different PQ disturbances and consequently assist in employing or implementing appropriate mitigation techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the two main types of classification methods for power quality disturbances based on underlying causes: deterministic classification, giving an expert system as an example, and statistical classification, with support vector machines (a novel method) as an example. An expert system is suitable when one has limited amount of data and sufficient power system expert knowledge; however, its application requires a set of threshold values. Statistical methods are suitable when large amount of data is available for training. Two important issues to guarantee the effectiveness of a classifier, data segmentation, and feature extraction are discussed. Segmentation of a sequence of data recording is preprocessing to partition the data into segments each representing a duration containing either an event or a transition between two events. Extraction of features is applied to each segment individually. Some useful features and their effectiveness are then discussed. Some experimental results are included for demonstrating the effectiveness of both systems. Finally, conclusions are given together with the discussion of some future research directions.},

	abstract = {IEEE 1159 is a recommended practice for monitoring electric power quality. Among the clauses within this standard is a section describing the measurement instruments for power quality monitoring. Depending on the situation being addressed, or the survey being made, a variety of different measuring instruments could be used. For simple situations, a handheld multimeter or oscilloscope could suffice. For more involved situations, a dedicate power quality monitor might be required. No matter how sophisticated, each measuring instrument has limitations that should be considered. Often these limitations are imposed by the response of the voltage and/or current probes and transducers, external to the measurement device. This paper outlines these various issues that should be considered when selecting a measuring instrument for use to measure power quality and its influence in an electrical power system.},

	title = {Distributed power quality monitoring},
	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6842882/},
	abstract = {One of the most important characteristics of the electric power system is its observability. The observability is essential not only for the power flows and power supply reliability indices, but also for the power quality indicators, particularly for the nonsinusoidality of supply voltage waveform. The wide use of power electronics components in intelligent electric power systems, which will increase in the future, leads to the occurrence of harmonic voltage and currents. Moreover, the electric power system facilities can be represented by both the sources and the consumers of high harmonics []. In this connection the assessment of impact of individual facilities on the power quality is a topical problem. The observability of electric power systems can be provided with the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The paper proposes a distributed power quality monitoring system based on the available PMU infrastructure to continuously control the level of high harmonics in different cutsets of the electric power system.},

	url = {http://projects-web.engr.colostate.edu/ece-sr-design/AY12/storage/docs/PQ_Final_Report.pdf},
	abstract = {The main goal of this project was to create a software system that analyzed data collected from smart meters and alerted the user of power quality issues. Power quality, for the purposes of this project, will be defined as IEEE Std 1159 states, “a wide variety of electromagnetic phenomena that characterize the voltage and current at a given time and at a given location on the power system.” Power quality metrics are defined by a percentage variance from the nominal value over a period of time. The metrics focused on in this report were limited by the resolution of data collected from the smart meters, which was 16.67 ms. This resolution allowed us to analyze disturbances including voltage sags, voltage swells, and harmonics (these disturbances will be further discussed in the body of the report). Along with these disturbances, we also found intervals in the data where low power factor (PF) was of concern.

During phase one; we researched definitions, causes, and effects of the aforementioned disturbances. From this, we determined that the best approach to classify these issues would be to use the per-unit system and classify them according to parameters set for power quality issues described in IEEE Std 1159. Once enough data was collected, algorithms were written to extract the data from a comma separated value (.csv) file and uploaded into MatLab. Once the data was uploaded into MatLab, techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and averaging sliding window were carried out to locate disturbances. The FFT gave us a means to traverse between the time domain and the frequency domain. The averaging sliding window acted as a low pass filter and got rid of noise that would otherwise flag the beginning of a disturbance haphazardly, ultimately slowing down our algorithms. The algorithms were written as functions, tested and compared with known results from other sources, and then added to a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI was designed to logically allow any user to plot and textually output any power quality issues, found within our resolution limits, for their own inspection.},

	abstract = {Electrical power quality (PQ) data is one of the prevalent types of engineering data. Its measurement at
relevant sampling rates leads to large volumes of PQ data to be managed and analyzed. In this paper, an
extensible database architecture is presented based on a novel generic data model for PQ data. The proposed
architecture is operated on the nationwide PQ data of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System
measured in the field by mobile PQ monitoring systems. The architecture is extensible in the sense that it
can be used to store and manage PQ data collected by any means with little or no customization. The
architecture has three modules: a PQ database corresponding to the implementation of the generic data
model, a visual user query interface to enable its users to specify queries to the PQ database and a query
processor acting as a bridge between the query interface and the database. The operation of the architecture
is illustrated on the field PQ data with several query examples through the visual query interface.
The execution of the architecture on this data of considerable volume supports its applicability and convenience
for PQ data.},

The MRA technique of DWT is employed to extract the discriminating features of distorted signals at different resolution levels. Subsequently, the PCA is used to condense information of a correlated set of variables into a few variables, and a RBF network is employed to classify the disturbance types.},
