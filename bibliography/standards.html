 Power Quality Standards: CBEMA, ITIC, SEMI F47, IEC

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Describes existing standards for power quality (CBEMA, ITIC, SEMI F47, IEC 61000). Problems with existing standards are that they advocate different test methods , do not require 3 phase sags, do not provide testing methodology, and only result in pass/fail.   References a new standard, IEEE P1668 to address these problems.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Presents reported costs of power quality problems, power quality definitions and terms, frequency of occurrence of power quality problems, causes of PQ not insufficent utility capacity, but rather distribution faults and short circuits. <p>
Conclusions: voltage sag is most common problem for industrial customers, majory of events are less than 200ms and from 10% to 50%, SEMI F47 compliance is helpful.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This part of IEC 61000-4 defines the methods for measurement and interpretation of results for power quality parameters in a.c. power supply systems with a declared fundamental frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.  Measurement methods are described for each relevant parameter in terms that give reliable and repeatable results, regardless of the method’s implementation. This standard addresses measurement methods for in-situ measurements.  Measurement of parameters covered by this standard is limited to conducted phenomena in power systems. The power quality parameters considered in this standard are power frequency, magnitude of the supply voltage, flicker, supply voltage dips and swells, voltage interruptions, transient voltages, supply voltage unbalance, voltage harmonics and interharmonics, mains signalling on the supply voltage, rapid voltage changes, and current measurements. Emissions in the 2 kHz to 150 kHz range are considered in Annex C (informative), and over- and underdeviations are considered in Annex D (informative).  Depending on the purpose of the measurement, all or a subset of the phenomena on this list may be measured.

 <em>IEEE Approved Draft Recommended Practice for Voltage
  Sag and Short Interruption Ride-Through Testing for End-Use
  Electrical Equipment Rated Less than 1000 V</em>.
 January 2016.
[&nbsp;<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7579535/">http</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
IEEE P1668 is a non-industry-specific trial use recommended practice for voltage sag and short interruption ride-through performance and compliance testing for all electrical and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage power systems that can experience malfunction or shutdown as a result of reductions in supply voltage lasting less than one minute. Testing procedures and requirements for test equipment are clearly defined within this document to reflect this electrical environment, including single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase balanced and unbalanced voltage sags. The recommended practice also defines requirements for certification and test reporting, including characterization of voltage-sag ride-through equipment. Current Status: Active
