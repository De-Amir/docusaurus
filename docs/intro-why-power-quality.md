Power quality is not currently a concern for most people in the United States.  Just like most citizens assume that their tap water is of adequate quality to drink, most also assume that their electricity is of adequate quality to power their homes and appliances without causing harm. And, in both cases, most people assume that it is the responsibility of public utilities to both monitor quality and correct any problems if they occur.

Successfully maintaining adequate power quality and providing sufficient amounts of it to meet the rising needs of consumers has been a triumph of electrical utilities in the United States for over 100 years.  In recent times, however, there have been two important changes to the nature of both electrical generation and consumption that make power quality of increasing concern and interest.

First, there is now a global movement away from centralized, fossil-fuel based forms of electrical energy generation and toward distributed, renewable alternatives such as wind and solar. This movement is particularly relevant to Hawaii, where over 80% of its electrical energy comes from oil, and where the average cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity is triple that of the mainland United States.  But the economic, environmental, and political advantages of renewable energy comes with significant new technical challenges: wind and solar are intermittent (for example, solar energy cannot be harvested at night) and unpredictable (for example, wind and solar energy fluctuate based upon cloud cover and wind speed).  In addition, renewable energy generation can be distributed throughout the grid (such as in the case of residential rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems).  

One impact of introducing renewable energy generation is that maintaining adequate power quality is much more challenging.  This has manifested itself in Hawaii in a very concrete way: the public demand to install rooftop solar far exceeds the ability of the Hawaiian Electric Company to allow it while maintaining adequate power quality. In many neighborhoods, new solar installation is prohibited because of the fear of its impact on not just power quality but overall grid stability.  

Second, the rise of consumer electronics has raised the bar for what constitutes "adequate" power quality. In only a few decades, computers have gone from being a rare presence outside of labs and factories to ubiquity: computers appear throughout society not only as stand-alone devices but embedded in phones, washers, refrigerators, thermostats, and so forth. Electronic devices not only have higher power quality requirements, but some of them actually introduce harmonic distortion back into the electrical circuits from which they receive their power.  Poor power quality can result in electronic devices failing unpredictably, or decreasing their lifespan.

So, on the one hand, adequate power quality is becoming more difficult to maintain, while on the other hand, our need for adequate power quality is increasing.  This brings up a third issue: electrical utilities are not necessarily required to be transparent about the quality of power they provide to consumers.  For example, in Hawaii, the utilities are required to make a "best effort" to provide voltage and frequency within 5% of nominal values, but are only required to publicly report on  outages of more than 3 minutes. There is no requirement to report potentially harmful deviations in voltage, frequency, or THD. 

These three issues inform the Open Power Quality project.  We are creating open source hardware and software technology that makes it both simple and affordable to provide publicly available, useful data on the quality of power provided to consumers and their homes and appliances. We hope that OPQ will:

* Create public awareness about power quality and empirical data regarding the quality of power they are provided; 

* Support improved understanding of the impact of renewable energy on residential power;

* Provide a source of power quality data that, when combined with other forms of information, results in better models that can enable increased amounts of renewable energy.

The next section provides more details on the design of OPQ.
