## What is Power Quality?

When power enters your home, it has a few expected characteristics that determine the quality of that power.
* That it is stable and non-interrupted
* That it maintains a stable voltage (*i.e.* 120 V)
* That it maintains a stable frequency (*i.e.* 60 Hz)
* That the waveform that makes up the power signal be transient free
* That the power signal has low harmonic distortion

Deviations from the above are considered power quality (PQ) issues.

## Types of Power Quality Issues

Here are some of the more common power quality issues:

* Voltage Sag: When the voltage drops below 10% to 90% of the nominal voltage for a duration of half a cycle to a minute.
* Undervoltage: When the voltage drops below 90% of the nominal voltage for a duration of over a minute
* Voltage Swell: When the voltage rises to 110% to 180% of nominal voltage for a duration of half a cycle to a minute.
* Overvoltage: When the voltage rises above 110% or more of nominal voltage for a duration of half a cycle to a minute.
* Voltage Flicker: When the voltage continuously transitions between multiple values between 90% and 110% of nominal voltage
* Voltage Transients: When there is a spike, impulse, or surge. 
* Frequency Sag: When the frequency drops below 99.9% of the standard
* Frequency Fluctuation: When the frequency fluctuates around the standard value
* Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): When the fraction of power in the sub-harmonics in respect to the main harmonic grow beyond a certain threshold
