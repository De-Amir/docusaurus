## Landing Page

The first OPQView page you normally encounter is the landing page, which looks like this: 

<img src="/docs/assets/view/opqview-landing-page.png" >

The landing page provides "public" data about the state of the OPQ system. It is public in the sense that anyone who can retrieve the top-level URL for OPQView can see this information without further authorization or authentication.  If you need this page to be private, please put the URL behind a firewall. 

## Profile Page

If you have login credentials for OPQ, you can login by clicking on the "Login" link in the upper right corner.  To obtain login credentials for an OPQ View system, you must request them from an administrator. After logging in, all users will have a Profile page that can be accessed from the NavBar.  Here is an example of that page:

The profile page provides information about your account, as well as information about all of the OPQBoxes for which you are a designated "owner". Note that it is possible for a single box to have more than one OPQ owner. It is also possible for an OPQBox to not have an owner.  

## Admin Page

If your account has admin privileges, after logging in you will have access to an Admin page as well as a Profile page.  The admin page looks like this:

<img src="/docs/assets/view/opqview-admin-page.png" >

The Admin page provides information about every OPQ Box in the system, regardless of whether the user is an owner or not. It also indicates who is an owner of each OPQ Box.

## About Page

The About page provides some background information about OPQ.  You do not have to be logged in to see this page.  It looks like this:
